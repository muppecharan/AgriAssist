The next step should focus on modifying the `get_deepseek_response` function or creating a wrapper to dynamically include relevant scraped content in the prompt based on the user's query.\n",
        "*   Manual evaluation of the test query responses is crucial. Based on this evaluation, refine the model generation parameters (e.g., `max_new_tokens`, `no_repeat_ngram_size`) or explore different DeepSeek model versions to improve response quality and relevance.\n"
